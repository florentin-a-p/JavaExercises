# JavaExercises
Flo's exercises in Java from https://www.udemy.com/course/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/

Since creating 1 repository for each exercise project would be redundant, I decided to give each project a new branch so I can store all of them in 1 repository. 
How to store a project to this repository:
1. initialize git in the project's directory using `git init`
2. add the remote to this repository using `git remote add origin git@github.com:florentin-a-p/JavaExercises.git`
3. add and commit files in the project directory as usual
4. push the files into this remote using `git push origin master:exerciseXXXXX`
5. the pushed files will appear in this repository as a new branch
